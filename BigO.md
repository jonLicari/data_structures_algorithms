# Big-O
Can tell us how well a program can be solved.

## What is Good Code?
1. Readable - is code clean
2. Scalable - Big O can tell us how performance scales
See complexity chart. Calculates amount of steps as opposed to amount of time for a given algorithm.

## O(n)
Number of operations increases linearly with the number of elements.

## O(1)
Constant time; no matter how many elements exist, the number of operations remains constant.
